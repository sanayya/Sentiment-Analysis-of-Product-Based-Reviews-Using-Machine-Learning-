The project deals with developing an automated text-based classification system capable of predicting whether a food review is positive or negative with high accuracy. 
The issue under consideration is to conduct a binary classification using a combination of text-based machine-learning features. The binary classes will be
defined as '1' for 'Positive Review' and '0' for 'Negative Review'. This study will employ various text-based features, including n-Grams, vectorized features such as
bag of words, term frequency inverse term frequency, and average word 2 vector. Logistic regression will be used for classification purposes. Additionally, this project
discusses the necessary text preprocessing methods because they contribute to avoiding overfitting and reducing computational complexity by removing noise from the text, 
such as common words.
